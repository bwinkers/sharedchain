# SharedChain Decentralized Management Structure
The SharedChain is managed by:
1. The SharedChain developers, this is (in the end) a software product and developers must have a strong voice.
2. The Service owners, they want to ensure the health of the chain.
3. The Entities have a lesser voice per link becasue they have a much smaller individual investment.
